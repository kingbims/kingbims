# Moremi Morakinyo

Hi there 👋 An overview about me:

* 🔭 I’m currently working on Express (REST and GraphQL APIs), NodeJS, projects using JavaScript, MongoDB, MySQl, PosrgresSql, deploying on AWS, Netlify or Digital Ocean.
* 🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript and NestJS, and also looking forward to learning Solidity.
* 👯‍♀️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will create value for developers and organizations.
* 🎯 I’m really big on clean and readable codebase, properly tested (unit and integration) and documented, automation (CI/CD) and following best practices.
* 💬 Ask me about NodeJS, Express, JavaScript
